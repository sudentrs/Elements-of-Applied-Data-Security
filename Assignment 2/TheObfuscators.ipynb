The OTP achieves perfect secrecy by XORing the plaintext with a random key that is as long as the message and used only once. However, due to the practical challenges of key generation and distribution, real-world stream ciphers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) to produce keystreams. \n",

This irregular clocking introduces unpredictability into the output sequence, making it harder for an attacker to analyze or reverse-engineer.\n",

This added complexity significantly raises the difficulty of reconstructing the internal state through known cryptanalytic techniques.Still, while ASGs are more secure than a single LFSR, they aren’t foolproof. If the parameters aren’t chosen carefully or if there isn’t enough non-linearity in the design, they can still be exposed to more advanced or targeted attacks."
