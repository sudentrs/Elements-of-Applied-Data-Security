    "Cryptography is key to protecting digital communication, and stream ciphers are commonly used for their speed and efficiency, especially in systems with limited processing power. These ciphers encrypt data one bit at a time using a keystream, which is generated by pseudorandom number generators like Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). While LFSRs are efficient, their linear nature can be a weakness. The Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm, for example, can reconstruct the shortest LFSR that produces a given output, making stream ciphers vulnerable to Known-Plaintext Attacks (KPA). To address these weaknesses, more complex designs like the Alternating Step Generator (ASG) are used. The ASG combines multiple LFSRs in a way that adds irregularity and non-linearity to the keystream, making it harder to analyze or predict [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, 3 classes were implemented to further demonstrate the concepts mentioned above; the Bits class, the LFSR class, and the AlternatingStep class, representing the ASG. Additionally, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm was implemented as a function to illustrate the KPA. This report explains the core components involved — including bit handling, LFSR construction, the Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm, and the ASG — to show how these systems work and where their strengths and weaknesses lie [2].\n"

    "Stream ciphers are symmetric key algorithms that encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, offering a faster and smaller alternative to block ciphers. Their  design is inspired by the One-Time Pad (OTP), introduced by Gilbert Vernam in 1917 and later formalized by Shannon [1]. According to the OTP, the key must be as long as the plaintext, uniformly distributed in the key space, and must be used only once to achieve perfect secrecy, information theory-wise. In both the OTP and modern stream ciphers, encryption and decryption follow the same procedure by applying the XOR operation between the plaintext (or ciphertext) and the keystream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key streams are generated using random number generators (RNGs), which must be both reproducible and unpredictable. Because true randomness found in nature is not reproducible, practical systems rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) instead to create keystreams [3]. A simple and efficient PRNG used in stream ciphers is the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), although its linear structure can make it vulnerable to certain types of attacks."

    "Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) are simple but powerful components often used to generate pseudorandom sequences in stream ciphers. An LFSR consists of a series of binary registers (bits) that shift their values at each step, with the new input bit determined by a linear function, typically the XOR of selected bits from the current state, defined by a feedback polynomial [4]. Despite their simplicity, LFSRs can produce sequences with long periods and good statistical properties.\n",

If an attacker can observe enough of the keystream, algorithms like Berlekamp-Massey can reconstruct the LFSR’s feedback polynomial and internal state, allowing full prediction of the remaining sequence. Regardless, they are the foundation for more complex and secure systems such as combination generators or the ASG.\n",

This process continues until the full sequence has been processed, and the minimal LFSR capable of producing that sequence is returned [2].

    "The Alternating Step Generator (ASG) is a stream cipher design that aims to overcome the weaknesses of individual LFSRs by combining multiple LFSRs in a non-linear and irregular fashion [5]. In a typical ASG setup, three LFSRs are used: two generate bits for output, while the third acts as a control register that determines which of the other two is clocked at each time instant. This irregular clocking introduces unpredictability into the output sequence, making it harder for an attacker to analyze or reverse-engineer. The output is then the XOR of the 2 LFSRs.\n",

    "The core idea behind the ASG is to break the linearity that makes LFSRs vulnerable to attacks like Berlekamp-Massey. By conditionally stepping LFSRs based on the output of a third, the generator produces a more complex and less predictable keystream, even if the individual components are linear. This added complexity significantly raises the difficulty of reconstructing the internal state through known cryptanalytic techniques [5]. Still, while ASGs are more secure than a single LFSR, they aren’t foolproof. If the parameters aren’t chosen carefully or if there isn’t enough non-linearity in the design, they can still be exposed to more advanced or targeted attacks."
